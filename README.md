2. **Products:** - Offers a detailed breakdown of product performance, focusing on the top 20 products by sales and profit margins. - Highlights the "Bikes" category, which dominates the sales volume, and provides insights into product profitability and management efficiency. 
3. **Internet (B2C Customers):** - Analyzes sales performance for direct customers through online channels, offering insights into customer behavior and sales trends. 
4. **Reseller (B2B Customers):** - Focuses on reseller sales, providing a detailed view of B2B transactions and performance metrics for different resellers.
