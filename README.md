This PowerBI dashboard was built using Microsoft's official AdventureWorks dataset, which includes order, customer, reseller, and product data. The dashboard is designed to help analyze sales performance and uncover valuable business insights, making it a useful tool for sales managers and BI engineers alike. 

## Project Overview 
This project is divided into four main sections: 
1. **Sales Summary:** - Provides an at-a-glance view of overall sales performance, including key metrics such as total sales, profit, and order volume. - Includes trend analysis, year-over-year (YOY) comparisons, and monthly sales performance. 
2. **Products:** - Offers a detailed breakdown of product performance, focusing on the top 20 products by sales and profit margins. - Highlights the "Bikes" category, which dominates the sales volume, and provides insights into product profitability and management efficiency. 
3. **Internet (B2C Customers):** - Analyzes sales performance for direct customers through online channels, offering insights into customer behavior and sales trends. 
4. **Reseller (B2B Customers):** - Focuses on reseller sales, providing a detailed view of B2B transactions and performance metrics for different resellers. 

## Key Features
 - **User-Friendly Navigation:** To assist users in navigating the dashboard, a "question mark" help button is included in the upper right corner. This feature provides guidance on how to use the dashboard, including tips on utilizing slicers and engaging with the customer/reseller drill-through functions. 
 - **Drill-Through Functionality:** When a specific customer or reseller is selected, a drill-through button becomes active, allowing users to navigate to a detailed page with in-depth information such as sales, order volume, profit, and more. Users can easily return to the main dashboard via a back button.
